===============================

This is project 4 of the Google Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Scholarship.

Thank you, Udacity, for providing the starter code.

Here is the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric).

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

** How to run
 Here is the [live version](https://magicmart.github.io/martin-arcade-game/)

 If you prefer, download the repository, extract the the zip folder, open the extracted folder and double click **index.html**. The game should open in your default browser.

 ** How to play

 There are 3 areas of this game world:

* At the top, the water
* In the middle, the path
* At the bottom, the grass

The player begins with 3 lives and is represented on screen by the image of a boy. The boy appears initially at the bottom of the screen, within the grassy area. He is safe there.
But boys like to swim - and there is enticing clear blue water at the top of the screen. All he has to do is **cross the path** to get there. Unfortunately, for him (and you) there are **giant bugs** in this world.(But none in the program) **Terrifying ladybirds**. Can you believe it? To be precise, there are 3 bugs that whiz across the path. If the boy hits one, he loses a life and goes back to the grass. But if he manages to reach the water, he gains one point and reappears on the grass.(What?). That is not all. There are **orange gems** to collect. These are very valuable. They increase the player's score by 5!

When the **boy** loses all his lives, the game is over. But don't worry, to bring the boy back to life you can play the game again! Cool.
