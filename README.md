**This is project 4 of the Google Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Scholarship.**

**Thank you, Udacity**, for providing the starter code.

Here is the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric).

## How to run
 Here is the [live version](https://magicmart.github.io/martin-arcade-game/)

 If you prefer, download the repository, extract the the zip folder, open the extracted folder and double click **index.html**. The game should open in your default browser.

## How to play

 There are 3 areas of this game world:

* At the top, the water
* In the middle, the path
* At the bottom, the grass

The player begins with 3 lives and is represented on screen by the image of a boy. The boy appears initially at the bottom of the screen, within the grassy area. He is safe there.
But boys like to swim - and there is enticing clear blue water at the top of the screen. All he has to do is **cross the path** to get there. Unfortunately, for him (and you) there are **giant bugs** in this world.(But none in the program) **Terrifying ladybirds**. Can you believe it? To be precise, there are 3 bugs that whiz across the path. If the boy hits one, he loses a life and goes back to the grass. But if he manages to reach the water, he gains one point and reappears on the grass.(What?). That is not all. There are **orange gems** to collect. These are very valuable. They increase the player's score by 5!

When the **boy** loses all his lives, the game is over. But don't worry, to bring the boy back to life you can play the game again! Cool.
